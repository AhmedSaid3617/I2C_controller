# I2C Transmitter

This project implements an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) controller, designed for digital design applications. The controller facilitates communication between a master device and one or more slave devices over the I2C protocol.

## Features

- Supports standard I2C protocol.
- Master transmits data and waits for ACK.
